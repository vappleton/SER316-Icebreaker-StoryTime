The whole disaster began when I tried to eat a Bratwurst inside a library, armed with nothing but a dry brot and reckless optimism. 
I tried to look innocent by the window with the Hauptstrasse (Main street) in sight, 
but an eye-catching Porsche outside hijacked my reckless optimism and totally blew my cover with the librarian.
Let me explain, I had just arrived at the Berlin Library to eat a bratwurst when I noticed something strange was going on.
Flames rise from all over. I swallow the brot and look for an escape. I saw a broken window that led to Hauptstrasse, and before I knew it, my body had jumped out of it and landed on the Porsche!
When suddenly a wild hund came out of nowhere and grabbed my Bratwurst and dirtied my Dirndel.
Still shaken, I walked my Hund past the Baeckerei while dreaming of Apfelkuchen and enjoying the Klimaanlage.
As I walked along, the dulcet tones of Rammstein began to fill my ears.
I followed the sound to a schloss eltz on top of a hil and down the cobblestone street, only to find the entire plaza transformed into a spontaneous Rammstein concert, with lederhosen-clad fans moshing wildly around a towering bratwurst stand. (cgwatari)
I began clapping along with the rhythm when my open palms received an aerial bratwurst that was apparently accidentally tossed by an overexcited fan. Talk about tables turning.
Skipping around to the concert, I noticed an enormous biergarten with more options than my watering taste buds could count.
