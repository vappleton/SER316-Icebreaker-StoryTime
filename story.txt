The whole disaster began when I tried to eat a Bratwurst inside a library, armed with nothing but a dry brot and reckless optimism. Flames rise from all over. I swallow the brot and look for an escape. I saw a broken window that led to Hauptstrasse, and before I knew it, my body had jumped out of it and landed on a Porsche!
