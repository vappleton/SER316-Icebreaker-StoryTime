The whole disaster began when I tried to eat a Bratwurst inside a library, armed with nothing but a dry brot and reckless optimism. 
Let me explain, I had just arrived at the Berlin Library to eat a bratwurst when I noticed something strange was going on.
Flames rise from all over. I swallow the brot and look for an escape. I saw a broken window that led to Hauptstrasse, and before I knew it, my body had jumped out of it and landed on a Porsche!
Still shaken, I walked my Hund past the Baeckerei while dreaming of Apfelkuchen and enjoying the Klimaanlage.
When suddenly a wild hund came out of nowhere and grabbed my Bratwurst and dirtied my Dirndel.
