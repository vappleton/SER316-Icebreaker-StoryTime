The whole disaster began when I tried to eat a Bratwurst inside a library, armed with nothing but a dry brot and reckless optimism. 
I tried to look innocent by the window with the Hauptstrasse (Main street) in sight, 
but an eye-catching Porsche outside hijacked my reckless optimism and totally blew my cover with the librarian.
Let me explain, I had just arrived at the Berlin Library to eat a bratwurst when I noticed something strange was going on.
Flames rise from all over. I swallow the brot and look for an escape. I saw a broken window that led to Hauptstrasse, and before I knew it, my body had jumped out of it and landed on the Porsche!
When suddenly a wild hund came out of nowhere and grabbed my Bratwurst and dirtied my Dirndel.
Still shaken, I walked my Hund past the Baeckerei while dreaming of Apfelkuchen and enjoying the Klimaanlage.
As I walked along, the dulcet tones of Rammstein began to fill my ears.
