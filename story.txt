The whole disaster began when I tried to eat a Bratwurst inside a library, armed with nothing but a dry brot and reckless optimism. 
I tried to look innocent by the window with the Hauptstrasse (Main street) in sight, 
but an eye-catching Porsche outside hijacked my reckless optimism and totally blew my cover with the librarian.
